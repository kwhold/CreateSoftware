# CreateSoftware
This repository contains the information (code, instructions, etc.) needed to implement the low-cost
OWI arm on a Create mobile robotic base.

The TestCode* directories hold various iterations of the Arduino code -- from the minimum necessary
to get the arm running to the actual code used in the brick-laying scenario.

This is a work-in-progress -- final code should be uploaded by 5/3/2016.
